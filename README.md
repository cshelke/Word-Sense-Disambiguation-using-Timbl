# Word-Sense-Disambiguation-using-Timbl
The task is to build a Word Sense Disambiguation System using SemEval-3 lexical sample data set and Timbl. Have used python library of pickle and hashmap from http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html. The output from the file keyWordExtractTrain.py gives a dictionary for each word with key as the sense-id and values are the unique words found in data set for that sense-id.
